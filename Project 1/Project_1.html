                    "Game 7 of the 1999-2000 Western Conference Finals was responsible for turning me 
                    into not only a Los Angeles Lakers fan, but also a sports fan in general. 
                    After being down by as much as 15 in the fourth quarter, Kobe Bryant tossed an alley-oop 
                    to Shaquille O’Neal that sealed the game and kickstarted a dynasty.
                    That happened when I was seven years old. On Sunday I opened my eyes out of a sleepy haze, and woke up to a 
                    flurry of text messages. It was the first time I woke up to a world without 
                    Kobe Bryant in it. It’s not a sentence I’d expected to type at only 28 years old.""

                    In the NBA, the best pictures have a general recipe to them. They all contain a mix of 
                    historical significance, composition, and symbolism through the limitations of their frame. 
                    Tallying up the best pictures in NBA history is ultimately a subjective feat. Since NBA action 
                    has pretty much ceased, it is time to reflect on the great pictures the league has given us over the years.
