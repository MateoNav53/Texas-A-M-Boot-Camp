                    "Game 7 of the 1999-2000 Western Conference Finals was responsible for turning me 
                    into not only a Los Angeles Lakers fan, but also a sports fan in general. 
                    After being down by as much as 15 in the fourth quarter, Kobe Bryant tossed an alley-oop 
                    to Shaquille O’Neal that sealed the game and kickstarted a dynasty.
                    That happened when I was seven years old. On Sunday I opened my eyes out of a sleepy haze, and woke up to a 
                    flurry of text messages. It was the first time I woke up to a world without 
                    Kobe Bryant in it. It’s not a sentence I’d expected to type at only 28 years old.""

                    In the NBA, the best pictures have a general recipe to them. They all contain a mix of 
                    historical significance, composition, and symbolism through the limitations of their frame. 
                    Some photos may be a little heavier on historical significance, while others symbolism, and others composition.
                    Tallying up the best pictures in NBA history is ultimately a subjective feat. Whichever of the three or more aspects the viewer views more important will ultimately dictate their opition.
                    Since NBA action has pretty much ceased, now is time to reflect on the great pictures the league has given us over the years.

                    A couple days ago I was listening to ESPN Senior Writer Zach Lowe's podcast, "The Lowe Post"
                    ( the best NBA podcast name around). He had the always insufferable - yet engaging - NBA color commentator 
                    Jeff Van Gundy on as a guest. I clicked on the podcast solely because I knew Jeff was going to have some 
                    dissenting opinions no matter what was said. He sure didn't disappoint!

                <h3>Spencer Dinwiddie Was Right About SoCal Basketball Players</h3>

                <p class="lefttext">
                    A small quote from Spencer Dinwiddie caused a lot of conversation recently in the NBA universe. 
                    When questioned by The Athletic’s Travonne Edwards about which state/region has produced the greatest haul of 
                    today’s NBA players, Dinwiddie remarked it was Southern California (SoCal) by a longshot. 
                    Spencer Dinwiddie on basketball Mecca: “I’m from LA listen here..It’s not even close we had Russ, James, 
                    Klay may or may not made it but was right there..Kawhi. We put more people on all-nba teams than some states have in the league!”
