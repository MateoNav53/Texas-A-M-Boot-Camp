                <h3>Bio</h3>
                <p>Mateo Navarrette was borned and raised in Los Angeles California. 
                    Naturally, he grew up to become a fiercely loyal fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and Dodgers. 
                    He got his start in sportswriting in 2018 when he joined the staff of <a href="https://steemit.com/@steemsports" target="_blank">Steemsports</a>, 
                    a sports account on the Steemit blockchain dedicated to covering sports news across the globe.   
                    He has since expanded his writing onto noted sites such as <a href="https://scorum.com/en-us/profile/@mateonav53" target="_blank">Scorum</a>, <a href="https://lastwordonprobasketball.com/author/mateonavarrette/" target="_blank">Last Word On Pro Basketball</a> and <a href="https://crownhoops.com/author/mateonavarrette/" target="_blank">Crownhoops</a>.
