                <h4>Kobe Bryant Remembered: Tears of Joy, Sorrow, and Inspiration</h4>
                <p class="italic">
                    "Game 7 of the 1999-2000 Western Conference Finals was responsible for turning me 
                    into not only a Los Angeles Lakers fan, but also a sports fan in general. 
                    After being down by as much as 15 in the fourth quarter, Kobe Bryant tossed an alley-oop 
                    to Shaquille O’Neal that sealed the game and kickstarted a dynasty. That happened when 
                    I was seven years old. On Sunday I opened my eyes out of a sleepy haze, and woke up to a 
                    flurry of text messages. It was the first time I woke up to a world without 
                    Kobe Bryant in it. It’s not a sentence I’d expected to type at only 28 years old.""

                <h3>Bio</h3>
                <p>Mateo Navarrette was borned and raised in Los Angeles California. 
                    Naturally, he became a fiercely loyal fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and Dodgers. 
                    He got his start in sportswriting in 2018 when he joined the staff of <a href="https://steemit.com/@steemsports" target="_blank">Steemsports</a>, 
                    a sports account on the Steemit blockchain dedicated to covering sports news across the globe.   
                    He has since expanded his writing onto noted sites such as <a href="https://scorum.com/en-us/profile/@mateonav53" target="_blank">Scorum</a>, <a href="https://lastwordonprobasketball.com/author/mateonavarrette/" target="_blank">Last Word On Pro Basketball</a> and <a href="https://crownhoops.com/author/mateonavarrette/" target="_blank">Crownhoops</a>. 
                    Mateo has covered baseball, football, and soccer throughout his career, but his true passion lies with the NBA.
                    Follow Mateo on <a href="https://twitter.com/MateoNav53" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for a steady stream of thought-provoking content, laughs, and memes.
                    He's one of the last people on the internet who is capable of having a civilized discussion with you - even if you're a Celtics fan.
