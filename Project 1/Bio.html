        <p>Mateo Navarrette was borned and raised in Los Angeles California. 
            Naturally, he turned into a fiercely loyal fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and Dodgers. 
            He got his start in sportswriting in 2018 when he joined the staff of <a href="https://steemit.com/@steemsports" target="_blank">Steemsports</a>, 
            the biggest sportswriting account on the Steemit blockchain.   
            He has since expanded his writing onto quality sportswriting sites such as <a href="https://scorum.com/en-us/profile/@mateonav53" target="_blank">Scorum</a>, <a href="https://lastwordonprobasketball.com/author/mateonavarrette/" target="_blank">Last Word On Pro Basketball</a> and <a href="https://crownhoops.com/author/mateonavarrette/" target="_blank">Crownhoops</a>. 
            Mateo has covered baseball, football, and soccer throughout his career, but his true passion lies with the NBA.

            Mateo gets the most joy out of writing articles that are big-picture, analytical, and have a long shelf-life, as opposed to fleeting news articles where the sole purpose is to collect views. Follow Mateo on <a href="https://twitter.com/MateoNav53" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for a steady stream of thought-provoking content, laughs, and memes.
            He's one of the last people on the internet who is capable of having a civilized discussion with you - even if you're a Celtics fan.</p>
