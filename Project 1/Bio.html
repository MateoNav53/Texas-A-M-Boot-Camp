        <p>Mateo Navarrette was borned and raised in Los Angeles California. 
            Naturally, he turned into a fiercely loyal fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and Dodgers. 
            He got his start in sportswriting in 2018 when he joined the staff of <a href="https://steemit.com/@steemsports" target="_blank">Steemsports</a>, 
            the biggest sportswriting account on the Steemit blockchain.   
            He has since expanded his writing onto quality sportswriting sites such as <a href="https://scorum.com/en-us/profile/@mateonav53" target="_blank">Scorum</a>, <a href="https://lastwordonprobasketball.com/author/mateonavarrette/" target="_blank">Last Word On Pro Basketball</a> and <a href="https://crownhoops.com/author/mateonavarrette/" target="_blank">Crownhoops</a>. 
            Mateo has covered baseball, football, and soccer throughout his career, but his true passion lies with the NBA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mateo gets the most joy out of writing articles that are big-picture, analytical, and have a long shelf-life, 
            as opposed to fleeting news articles where the sole purpose is to collect views. There are enough redundant news articles, aimless GOAT debates, and blowhard pundits shouting at the top of their lungs to go around. Mateo provides the alternative to that with his content. 
            Follow Mateo on <a href="https://twitter.com/MateoNav53" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for a steady stream of thought-provoking content, laughs, and memes.
            He's one of the last people on the internet who is capable of having a civilized discussion with you - even if you're a Celtics fan.</p>
