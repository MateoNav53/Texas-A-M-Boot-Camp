**Project Overview**&nbsp;
- This is a personal website built by Mateo Navarrette to display his best articles related to sportswriting. It's intended to introduce new readers to his best articles and showcase his writing to potential employers. 
&nbsp;**Technologies Used**&nbsp;
- The project utilizies HTML with CSS Stylesheets, along with a little javascript embedded in the HTML.&nbsp;
&nbsp;**Details on Functionality**&nbsp;
- The project consists of three total webpages. Users can scroll through the main "articles" page, which displays seven of Mateo's best articles, and then navigate to two other ones. One page has a Biography and the other is a form for contacting Mateo for anything ranging from casual discussion to job opportunities.&nbsp;
&nbsp;**Ideas for Future Improvement**&nbsp;
In terms of improvement, (1) A search bar could be added to search all of Mateo's articles from a database (2) Small javascript functions could be added to add some visual flare, i.e. animations for new pages loading up. (3) A large, stylish background photo could be added as seen on other personal websites. (4) An image carousel could be added after more articles are written, and therefore more content is available to add. &nbsp;
&nbsp;**Note**&nbsp;
A code generator was used through Twitter's website to obtain the code needed to post the Twitter follow button at the top of every page and the embedded Twitter timeline in the Biography section.
